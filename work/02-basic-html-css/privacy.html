                    Other University departments' websites and services may have additional privacy and data practices, but our <a class="index_link" href="index.html">Main page</a> won't do that. The privacy and data practices of those sites and services may be further governed by supplemental privacy notices, and you should read any supplemental privacy notices available on the websites and services of the specific department, unit, or function you interact with for more information on their practices.

When you participate in such research studies, you will be provided with an informed consent form which may describe the additional and/or different data practices and policies that will apply to the study and which may supersede the practices set out in this Privacy Statement.
